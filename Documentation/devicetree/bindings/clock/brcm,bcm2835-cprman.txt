Broadcom BCM2835 CPRMAN clocks

This binding uses the common clock binding:
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

The CPRMAN clock controller generates clocks in the audio power domain
of the BCM2835.  There is a level of PLLs deriving from an external
oscillator, a level of PLL dividers that produce channels off of the
few PLLs, and a level of mostly-generic clock generators sourcing from
the PLL channels.  Most other hardware components source from the
clock generators, but a few (like the ARM or HDMI) will source from
the PLL dividers directly.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "brcm,bcm2835-cprman"
- #clock-cells:	Should be <1>. The permitted clock-specifier values can be
		  found in include/dt-bindings/clock/bcm2835.h
- reg:		Specifies base physical address and size of the registers
- clocks:	The external oscillator clock phandle
- #address-cells number of cells required to define a clock
- #size-cells    Should be 0

Subnodes:

It is possible to apply optional settings per clock to modify clock
selection behaviour.
For each clock there may be a subnode that may contain the following:

Required properties:
- reg                 -  clock id

Optional properties:
- parent-clock-names  - list of parrent-clock names
  		        this list is validated againt the default list
		        of parent clocks and is used in this order.
- brcm,clock-selector - the clock selector to use
- brcm,mash-max-order - the maximum order of the fractional divider
- brcm,min-fract-div  - the minimum divider required when using
  		      	the fractional divider

Example:

	clk_osc: clock@3 {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		reg = <3>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "osc";
		clock-frequency = <19200000>;
	};

	clocks: cprman@7e101000 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-cprman";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x7e101000 0x2000>;
		clocks = <&clk_osc>;

		address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		/* custom settings for the PCM clock */
		clock@BCM2835_CLOCK_PCM {
			 reg = <BCM2835_CLOCK_PCM>;
			 parent-clock-names = "xosc", "plld_per";
			 brcm,clock-selector =
				  <BCM2835_CHOOSE_CLOCK_INTEGER_THEN_FRAC>;
			 brcm,mash-max-order = <BCM2835_MASH_ORDER_3>;
			 brcm,min-fract-div = <20>;
		};
	};

	i2c0: i2c@7e205000 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-i2c";
		reg = <0x7e205000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <2 21>;
		clocks = <&clocks BCM2835_CLOCK_VPU>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
